# Check if strings are ONE_EDIT_AWAY

There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.

e.g.-
```
pale, ple -> true
pales, pale -> true
pale, balse -> true
pale, bae -> false
```
